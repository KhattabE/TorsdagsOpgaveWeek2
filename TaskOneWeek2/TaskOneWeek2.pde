//Task 1: I denne opgave skal du lave en switch, som printer antal dage i de forskellige m√•neder.

//Declaring a variable of data type String, and assigning it the value "Januar"
String month = "February";

//Declaring a variable of data type int
int days;






//A switch case to check what month it is, and it will print their days based on that
switch(month) {
